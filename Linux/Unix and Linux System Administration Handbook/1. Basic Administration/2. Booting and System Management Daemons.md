- The boot process consists of a few broadly defined tasks
	- Finding, loading, and running bootstrapping code 
	- Finding, loading, and running the OS kernel
	- Running startup scripts and system daemons
	- Maintaining process hygiene and managing system state transitions

- ## 2.1 Boot Process Overview

	- UEFI (**U**nified **E**xtensible **F**irmware **I**nterface) simplified the early stages of the booting process, now the modern gnu-linux distribuitions uses *systemd* insted of UNIX init.
	- **systemd** streamlines the boot process by adding dependency management, support for concurrent startup process, comprehensive approach to logging, among other features.
	- the procedures for booting the system are managed for a series of shell scripts called "init scrips".
 
- ## 2.2 System Firmware
	- When a machine is powered on, the CPU is hardwired to execute boot code stored in ROM. On virtualized systems, this “ROM” may be imaginary, but the concept remains the same.
	- The system firmware is aware of the devices on the motherboard, including SATA controllers, network interfaces, USB controllers, and power/temperature sensors. It allows hardware-level configuration of these devices and provides options to expose them to the operating system or disable/hide them.
 
- ### BIOS vs UEFI
	- Traditional PC firmware was called the BIOS, for Basic Input/Output System. Over the last decade, however, BIOS has been supplanted by a more formalized and modern standard, the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). You’ll often see UEFI referred to as “UEFI BIOS”.
	- UEFI is the current revision of an earlier standard, **EFI**. References to the name EFI persist in some older documentation and even in some standard terms, such as "EFI system partition".
 
- ### Legacy BIOS
	- The traditional BIOS boot process involves the use of a Master Boot Record (MBR) located on the boot device. The MBR contains a small first-stage boot loader and a basic partitioning table.
	- The first-stage boot loader, also known as the boot block, is very small and has limited capabilities. It is responsible for locating and loading the second-stage boot loader.
	- The second-stage boot loader is stored either in the active disk partition or in the dead zone between the MBR and the first partition. It is more advanced and capable of understanding different operating systems and filesystems, once the second-stage boot loader is loaded, it takes over the boot process and loads the operating system into memory. To ensure a successful boot, all components of the boot chain, including the MBR boot block, second-stage loader, and operating system, must be properly installed and compatible with each other.
	- The MBR boot block is not specific to any particular operating system but assumes a specific location for the second-stage loader. This allows for the installation of multiple versions of the second-stage loader.
 
- ### UEFI
	- The UEFI specification includes a modern disk partitioning scheme known as GPT (GUID Partition Table, where GUID stands for “globally unique identifier”). UEFI also understands FAT (File Allocation Table) filesystems, a simple but functional layout that originated in MS-DOS. These features combine to define the concept of an EFI System Partition (ESP). At boot time, the firmware consults the GPT partition table to identify the ESP. It then reads the configured target application directly from a file in the ESP and executes it.
	- Because the ESP is mounted in generic FAT it can be manipulated by any operating system.
	- UEFI defines standard APIs for acessing the system's hardware, operating systems can use the UEFI API or they can take over direct control of the hardware
	- We can examine and modify UEFI variables on a running system with the command *efibootmgr*
	- The ability to modify the UEFI configuration from user space means that the firmware's configuration information is mounted read/write systems (typically, those with systemd) that allow write access by default, *rm -rf /* can be enough to permanently destroy the system at the firmware level; in addition to removing files, rm also removes variables and other UEFI information accessible through /sys
 
- ### BOOT Loaders
	- The bootloader's main job is to identify and load an appropriate operating system kernel. Most boot loaders can also present a boot-time user interface that lets you select which of several possible kernels or operating systems to invoke. Another task that falls to the boot loader is the marshaling of configuration arguments for the kernel. The kernel doesn’t have a command line per se, but its startup option handling will seem eerily similar from the shell. For example, the argument **single** or **-s** usually tells the kernel to enter single-user mode instead of completing the normal boot process.

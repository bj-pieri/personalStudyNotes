- ## 2.6.2 HTTP Streaming and DASH
	- The video is simply stored at an HTTP server as an ordinary file with a specific *URL* and the client stablishes a TCP connection with the server and issue and HTTP *GET* for that *URL*.
	- The streaming starts once the number of bytes exceeds a predetermined threshold in the buffer at client side
	- in **DASH (Dynamic Adaptative Streaming HTTP)** the video is encoded in different versions, with each versions with different bit rate end
	- each video in DASH is stored in a different HTTP server and uses a *manifest file* to provide URL for each version of encoded videos
	- he client then selects one chunk at a time by specifying a URL and a byte range in an HTTP GET request message for each chunk. While downloading chunks, the client also measures the received bandwidth and runs a rate determination algorithm to select the chunk to request next

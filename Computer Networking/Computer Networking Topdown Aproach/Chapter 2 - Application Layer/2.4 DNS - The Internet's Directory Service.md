- DNS is defined in [RFC 1034](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1034) and [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035) , and updated in several additional RFCs.
- There is two ways to identify a host -- by a hostname and by a IP adress.
- The DNS is (1) a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of DNS servers, and (2) an application-layer protocol that allows hosts to query the distributed database. The DNS servers are often UNIX machines running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) software (BIND 2020). The DNS protocol runs over UDP and uses port 53.
- DNS adds an additional delay, sometimes substantial to the internet application that use it. Fortunately the desired IP adress is often cached in a "nearby" DNS server
- DNS also provides: 
	- Host aliasing, resolving complicated hostnames with aliases
	- Mail server aliasing, When it comes to email addresses, the simplicity and memorability of the user's address, such as [bob@yahoo.com](mailto:bob@yahoo.com), contrasts with the more complex and less mnemonic hostname of the email server, like relay1.west-coast.yahoo.com. To resolve this, DNS (Domain Name System) can be used by a mail application to obtain the canonical hostname for an alias hostname and retrieve the IP address of the host. DNS allows companies to assign identical hostnames to their mail server and web server using MX records. For instance, both the mail server and web server of a company can be named *enterprise.com*.
	- Load distribuition, DNS enables load distribution among replicated servers by associating a set of IP addresses with an alias hostname. The DNS database stores this set of IP addresses, and when clients make a DNS query, the server responds with the entire set of IP addresses, rotating their ordering to distribute traffic. This technique applies to both replicated web servers and email servers, ensuring efficient distribution. Content distribution companies like Akamai also utilize DNS for advanced web content distribution.
- The DNS (Domain Name System) protocol, like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, is an application-layer protocol that operates between communicating end systems using the client-server model. It relies on an underlying end-to-end transport protocol to transfer DNS messages between these systems. However, the role of DNS differs from applications like the Web, file transfer, and e-mail. Unlike those applications, DNS is not directly interacted with by users. Instead, DNS serves as a fundamental Internet function by translating hostnames to their corresponding IP addresses for user applications and other software in the Internet. This design reflects the philosophy of distributing complexity to the network's edges, where DNS implements the critical name-to-address translation process with clients and servers located at the edge of the network.
- DNS usese a large number of servers, organized in a hierarchical fashion and distributed around the world
- No single DNS server has all of the mappings for all of the hosts in the Internet. Instead, the mappings are distributed across the DNS servers. To a first approximation, there are three classes of DNS servers—root DNS servers, top level domain (TLD) DNS servers, and authoritative DNS servers.

 - a closer look at classes of DNS servers:
	 - **Root DNS servers** There are more than 1000 root servers instances scattered all over the world, as shown in Figure 2.18. These root servers are copies of 13 dif- ferent root servers, managed by 12 different organizations, and coordinated through the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority [IANA 2020]. The full list of root name servers, along with the organizations that manage them and their IP addresses can be found at [Root Servers 2020]. Root name servers provide the IP addresses of the TLD servers.
	 - **Top-level domain (TLD)** servers. For each of the top-level domains—top-level domains such as com, org, net, edu, and gov, and all of the country top-level domains such as uk, fr, ca, and jp—there is TLD server (or server cluster). The company Verisign Global Registry Services maintains the TLD servers for the com top-level domain, and the company Educause maintains the TLD servers for the edu top-level domain. The network infrastructure supporting a TLD can be large and complex; see [Osterweil 2012] for a nice overview of the Verisign net- work. See [TLD list 2020] for a list of all top-level domains. TLD servers provide the IP addresses for authoritative DNS servers.
	 - **Authoritative DNS servers** Every organization with publicly accessible hosts (such as Web servers and mail servers) on the Internet must provide publicly accessible DNS records that map the names of those hosts to IP addresses. An organization’s authoritative DNS server houses these DNS records. An organi- zation can choose to implement its own authoritative DNS server to hold these records; alternatively, the organization can pay to have these records stored in an authoritative DNS server of some service provider. Most universities and large companies implement and maintain their own primary and secondary (backup) authoritative DNS server.
	 - **Local DNS** is an essential component of the DNS architecture, although it doesn't strictly fit into the hierarchical structure of DNS servers. Each Internet Service Provider (ISP), whether residential or institutional, maintains its own local DNS server, also known as a default name server. When a host connects to an ISP, the ISP assigns one or more IP addresses of its local DNS servers to the host through DHCP. Users can easily find the IP address of their local DNS server by accessing network status windows on their operating systems. The local DNS server is typically geographically close to the host, residing on the same LAN for institutional ISPs or separated by a few routers for residential ISPs. When a host sends a DNS query, it is directed to the local DNS server, which acts as a proxy by forwarding the query into the DNS server hierarchy for resolution. Further details about this process will be discussed below.
